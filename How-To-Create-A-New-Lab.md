# How To Create A New Lab

To create a new lab:

  1. Read through the lab: [Writing Learning Labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com:8867/lab/00-labs-01-getting_started/step/1)
  1. For reference, look at how the [Basic Lab Template](https://learninglabs.cisco.com:8867/lab/00-basic-02-basic_template/step/1) appears in the learning lab environment. This is an example of how the template looks when rendered on the DevNet Learning Lab staging server.
  1. Copy the files of the Basic Lab Template [source in Github](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-guidelines/tree/master/labs) to your local workspace.
  1. Add your lab files to an existing repo or create your own repo in the [CiscoDevNet](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet) organization.
  1. Let one of the Learning Lab admins know when you are ready to publish.

You should publish your lab for review to the DevNet <a target="_blank" href="https://learninglabs.cisco.com:8867">Learning Lab staging server</a> (notice that the staging server is on port number 8867). 

When your lab is ready for release, an admin will need to publish it for you to the production server. See
