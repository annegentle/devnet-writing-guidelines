****To create a new lab:

  1. Read through the lab: [Writing Learning Labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com:8867/lab/00-labs-01-getting_started/step/1)
  1. For reference, look at the [Basic Lab Template](https://learninglabs.cisco.com:8867/lab/00-basic-02-basic_template/step/1). That gives you an idea of how the template looks when rendered on the DevNet Learning Lab staging server.
  1. Copy the files of the Basic Lab Template from the [files in Github](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-guidelines/tree/master/labs) to your local workspace. Make sure to include the parent directory called `Basic Lab Template`.
  1. Modify the template with your content.
  1. On Github, under the [CiscoDevNet](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet) organization, add the lab files you just created to: 
      * an existing repo, or 
      * a repo that you created

When your lab files are ready to be published, let one of the Learning Lab admins know the following information:

  * repo name
  * lab title
  * lab ID

Ask the admin to publish your lab for review to the DevNet <a target="_blank" href="https://learninglabs.cisco.com:8867">Learning Lab staging server</a> (notice that the staging server is on port number 8867). This will give you and others a chance to review the content before publishing to the production server.

When your lab is ready for release, an admin will publish it for you to the production server. If you have **Publisher** permissions, see the wiki page on [How To Publish Labs](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-writing-guidelines/wiki/How-To-Publish-Labs).
