When creating learning labs, modules and tracks, we are often in a position of needing to use or instruct a user to use a particular tool to accomplish some task.  Which tool to use can often spiral into a _religious_ argument wherein actually all sides are usually _right_ for their own purposes.  ...but we still need to provide instructions to the user on what to do, so some consensus is needed.

There are many ways to do do things.  **We need one way that works for instructional purposes.**


# Audience

Considering the audience that the content has been created for may provide us with sufficient criteria to make a tool selection or alleviate the need to do so all-together.


# Basic vs. Full-Featured

Full-featured tools are nice, add complexity and abstract some of the essential "goings on" from the view of the user.  For new learners, using such full featured tools can:
- Cause confusion
- Create a steeper learning curve as the learner struggles with both the content and the tool(s)
- Result in the learner starting out on less-sure foundation as they aren't aware of all that the full-featured tool has done for them


# Principles

## For Content Targeting New Learners
* Use the most Basic Tools possible.
* Tool fatigue is real.
* Don't introduce a new tool unless it is absolutely necessary.
* It takes time to introduce a new tool.
* Repetition and consistency in using a small set of tools will build learner confidence.

Individuals will naturally graduate to more sophisticated tools as their skills mature and they find that **they have a want/need for them**.  At this point they should have a firmer foundation, and will appreciate and understand what the tool is doing for them.

## For Content Targeting More Advanced Learners
* Do you have to recommend a tool?  Advanced learners likely already have a preference and proficiency with using their own set of tools.
* Consider that it may be sufficient just to instruct them on the action(s) that need to be taken.
* If you must provide or instruct that a specific tool be used:
  * Instruct them that this is the tool that we will be using for instructional purposes.
  * They may use a different tool if they prefer.
  * We will only be 'supporting' the tool that we have provided instructions to use.
  * If their tools don't work or produce the same results... They are on their own.
