## Need To Look At These Labs

### Possible Redundant Labs

| --------- | ------ | ---- | ----------------------- |
| REST API Basics | 00-prep-02-overview-of-rest-apis |   repo? | Module [LM-4402:REST APIs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/devnet-express-np-rest-python) in [DNE CC](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-express-cloud-collab-it-pro) |

### Possible Redundant Modules
