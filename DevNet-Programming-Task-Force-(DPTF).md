I offer it up as a recently updated and curated starting point that we could build from, or completely deviate from."

| Data types         | Understand purpose of int, boolean, etc. |   |
| REST API calls     | Concepts on how APIs work<br>basic GET/POST/PUT/DELETE <br> authorization|   |
| Importing libraries | `Requests`  |   |
| Variables|   |   |
|  Data Types |   |   |
| Operators  |   |   |
| Control structures  |  - for<br>  -while   |   |
