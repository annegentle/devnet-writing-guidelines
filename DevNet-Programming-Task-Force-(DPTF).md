    Hank wrote: "As part of the Network Programmability Video course, I created a 'Programming Fundamentals' module that provides the foundation in Python, APIs and Data Formats needed for the reset of the technical modules. ... I offer it up as a recently updated and curated starting point that we could build from, or completely deviate from."


## List of learning objectives

What are the learning objectives (skills and knowledge) that DevNet considers part of core programming fundamentals?

| Learning Objective (language-independent) | Non-technology specific Description  | Examples or commands that should be included |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ---- |
| Github             | Understand basics about repos | clone<br>pull<br>push |
| REST API calls     | Concepts on how APIs work|   |
|                    | Resources and Endpoints |   |
|                    | HTTP Operations  | GET/POST/PUT/DELETE  ???Spark API??? |
|                    | Authorization |   |
| Language-specific | Python fundamentals |   |
|                   | Powershell fundamentals |   |

| Importing libraries | `Requests`  |   |
| Variables|   |   |
| Data types | Understand data types |  int<br>boolean  |
| Operators  |   |   |
| Control structures  |  - for<br>  -while   |   |
