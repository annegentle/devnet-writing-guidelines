### Headings

For the sake of consistency, we require that you as an author include the following headings in every lab.

### Objectives

Use a bullet list to explain the learning objectives of the lab. These are the skills or knowledge you expect the student to walk away with after completing the lab. Make this short and to the point. Typically there are 1-4 objectives. List the objectives in the same order that the topics are covered in the lab.

#### Example

> After completing this lab you will be able to:
>  - Make API calls to an ACI server
>  - Understand the API Object Model and its tree structure
>  - Identify ACI Objects by Name and Class


### Estimated Time (Deprecated)

The older lab templates have a place for putting the estimated time that it takes to complete the lab.

**DO NOT** included the estimate time. The estimate time is now pulled automatically from the lab's JSON file. We don't want potential inconsistency between the time stated in the lab, and the time in the JSON file.  For that reason, the only place you as an author should put the estimate time is in the lab's JSON (metadata) file.

### Prerequisites

List any required tools, knowledge, or skills that the student should have before starting the lab.
